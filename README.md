## Technology Decisions for React

### Routing: React Router

React Router is the standard routing library for React. It allows for the creation of single page applications with navigation along different routes.

### HTTP requests: fetchAPI

Fetch API provides a powerful and flexible method of fetching resources from the server. It is the modern, promise-based successor of XMLHttpRequest. It allows you to make requests similar to HTTP, get the response, and process it as needed. This makes it a great choice for any kind of HTTP request, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. It's built into the window object, so you can use it in the browser without importing any libraries.

### Styling: Tailwind

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

### Remote State Management: Context API

The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables you to share state and other data between multiple components without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## Technology Decisions for Node.js

### Framework: Express.js

Express.js is a fast, open-source, minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building APIs.

### Database: MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database. It allows for working with JSON-like documents and meets the demands of high volume data storage.
